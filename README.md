Project description :

-A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained to classify 133 dog breeds which takes in an input image, detects if it is a dog or a human and then predicts the breed of dog it resembles to. Also used transfer learning using ResNet50 image classification model to improve accuracy.

- This was my Capstone Project for Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.
